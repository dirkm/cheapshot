# cheapshot :: chess engine

## warning

Cheapshot is in early construction phase, and has been for some time.

Is is meant to be a chess-engine written in C++0x, and should take advantage of 64 bit arithmetic.
In order to build, boost is required.

Currently, I am working on board setup, and piece-moves. No AI yet.
You might want to check back in a couple of years.
